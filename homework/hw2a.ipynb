    "This assignment establishes your professional development environment using terminal (macOS) or Git Bash (Windows) and conda. You'll move beyond Jupyter notebooks to understand the broader ecosystem that supports data science work - the command line tools, environment management, and utilities that make reproducible analysis possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Build skills with terminal navigation and file manipulation for efficient development workflows\n",
    "- Create and manage isolated Python environments for reproducible analysis\n",
    "- See how conda manages complete development environments, not just Python packages\n",
    "- Create Python scripts and run them from the command line\n",
    "- Discover new tools that enhance the command line experience\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you'll have a properly configured development environment and the skills to maintain it. You'll understand why environments matter for reproducible work and have practical experience with tools that will make your future development more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment should take 60-90 minutes to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generative AI Allowance\n",
    "You may use GenAI tools for brainstorming, explanations, and debugging if you disclose it, understand it, and validate it. Your submission must represent your own work and you are solely responsible for its correctness.\n",
